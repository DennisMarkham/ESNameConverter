<!-- so regex ideas:
Argonian:
-e without another e before or after it must become a double ee
RegEx theory: /[^e][e][^e]/
-"is" becomes "us" if its at the end (space after it)
RegEx theory: /(is)/
-There's a hyphen if two names are provided, or apostrophe?
RegEx theory: /\s/

Imperial:
-male name must end with "ius", female with "a"
Regex theory: /[a-z]\s/ for first name.  Somehow I have $ for the last character
-Remove apostrophes

Orc:
-Last name (name with space before but not after) is prefaced with gro- or gra- depending on gender
Regex theory: /\s/ replace with " gra-" or " gro-"
-Replace certian suffixes with "grum"
RegEx Theory: /[(uel)(dra)(is)]/
-Remove apostropes
-S at the beginning becomes Sh, s in the middle or end becomes z.  Maybe simple based this on capitalization? -->
